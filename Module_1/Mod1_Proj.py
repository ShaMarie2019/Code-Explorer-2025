# Lets create a calculator and make sure it works


def calculator(x, y, operation):
    #define sum, product, difference, and quotient 
    sum = x + y

    if operation == "add":
        return sum
    elif operation == "multiply":
        return product
    elif operation == "subtraction":
        return difference
    else:
        return quotient

 

#Call the function




#Call the function and print 


print(calculator())

#Assign the called function to a variable 

var = calculator()



'''
1. Call the calculator function with two numbers and an operation (e.g., "add", "subtract", "multiply", or "divide"), 
and store the result in a variable (e.g., var1).


2. Repeat Step 1 with a different set of inputs and store the result in another variable (e.g., var2).

3. Call the calculator function again using the two previously stored variables as inputs, along with a new operation, 
and store the result in a new variable (e.g., var3).
